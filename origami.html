    <h1>Origami</h1>
    Everything on this website is an original design by me and every design I have ever made is on this site in reverse chronilogical order. These are not my nicest looking folds I have ever made. Those were designed by other people and you can find them on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/elip.origami/">Instagram</a>. Even though I am a pretty advanced folder, I am still a beginner at design, so bear that in mind and give me a little grace.
    <h2>Flying Fish</h2>
    I designed this model as part of a design competition with the topic fish. I am really happy with it and I feel like it's the best thing I have made so far and I am getting better.

    <h2>Cyborg Walrus</h2>
    I designed this model in round 1 of a tournament and the theme was cyborg animals. I think that this was over ambitious and I wasn't ready to make something this complicated look convincing.

    <h2>Fairy</h2>
    I designed this model to gain entrance into a tournament. It was a quick sketch and I didn't end up having paper for arms.

        <img src="Pictures/CreasePatterns/fairycp.jpg" alt="Fairy Crease Pattern" width="400" height="400">

    <h2>Frog</h2>
    I designed this model as part of a tournament and the theme was cute. I was on vacation and had very limited time and paper.
    <table></table>

        <img src="Pictures/CreasePatterns/frogcp.jpg" alt="Frog Crease Pattern" width="400" height="400">

      </tr>
    </table>
    <h2>Desperation</h2>
    I designed this model as part of a tournament and the theme was emotion. I was going for a person fighting desperately against some sort of Lovecraftian horror. I think this was too ambitious and I need to get better at photography.

      <tr>
        <img src="Pictures/CreasePatterns/desperationcp.jpg" alt="Desperation Crease Pattern" width="400" height="400">

    <h2>Atlas</h2>
    This is my first ever design and the theme was mythology. This is definitely not perfect but for a first design I am very proud.
